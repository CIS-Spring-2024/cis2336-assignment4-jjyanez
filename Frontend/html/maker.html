    <p>Jonathan Yanez is a junior student at the University
        of Houston as a Computer Information Systems Major.
        Jonathan as a student has gained a proficienscy in the 
        C++, MATLAB, and Python coding languages. Jonathan has 
        kindly assisted us with moderate skill level to design
        this very site. While he still has plenty of room for 
        improvement, he clearly shows enthusiasm and (somewhat moderate)
        effort. Look forward to continuing updates as he continues to 
        work on improving your experience. (Cuz his final grade will surely NEED IT)
